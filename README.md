# ELEC390 Projects

This GitHub repository compiles the setup guide and three projects for Queen's University ELEC390: Engineering Design and Development (updated for the Winter 2024 semester).

If you are a student, you should have received a GitHub Classroom link on onQ, enabling you to clone and edit a private copy of this repository for your team submission.

This repository consists of four directories:
1) **Setup:** Guides you on the installation of Ubuntu, Duckietown shell, and Python.
2) **Braitenberg:** The first project involves developing algorithms to detect duckies (pedestrians) and navigate around them.
3) **Collision Avoidance:** The second project entails developing a CNN to detect duckies on a road and avoid colliding with them.
4) **Lane Following:** The third project involves developing algorithms for lane navigation.

Each project directory will lead you to the relevant Duckietown learning experiences and outline the grading criteria for the software component.

To submit your software deliverable, you must submit your algorithm to Duckietown for autograding and upload a markdown file to your GitHub Classroom repository containing your submission link. Our autograder will access your submission on Duckietown, collect all grading criteria, and provide you with a grade on onQ.

Consult onQ for information regarding other deliverables, including the engineering report, ethical commentary, and project management document.
